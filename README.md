# Blog_Website
Okay to stand up the project properly you need to set up a few things before running the project.
The first thing you need creates a virtual environment.
Then you should run this command in your project terminal 𝐩𝐢𝐩𝟑 𝐢𝐧𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐥𝐥 𝐟𝐥𝐚𝐬𝐤_𝐦𝐲𝐬𝐪𝐥𝐝𝐛.
Second thing you should also download the email_validator (𝐩𝐢𝐩 𝐢𝐧𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐥𝐥 𝐞𝐦𝐚𝐢𝐥_𝐯𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐨𝐫) package also.
And that's all I hope you liked my small blog project.
