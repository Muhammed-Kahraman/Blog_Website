# Blog_Website
Okay to stand up the project properly you need to set up a few things before running the project.
The first thing you need creates a virtual environment.
Then you should run this command in your project terminal pip3 install flask_mysqldb.
Second thing you should also download the email_validator package also.
And that's all I hope you liked my small blog project.
